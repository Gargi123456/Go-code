            <h1>WHAT YOU'LL LEARN...</h1>
            <p>Not so long ago, only a few people were considered computer programmers, and we viewed them with awe. In the digital age, we now live in; however, many IT jobs require a solid grasp of a programming language, and sometimes more than one. If youâ€™re trying to advance in your career or change careers completely, and you realize you need to master a programming language, you might wonder which one to learn. After all, it will take time and money to learn the language, so you want to make the right choice from the start.</p>
            <div class="content-item">
                <h1>1.C/C++</h1>

                <p>C is probably the oldest commonly used programming language, and it is the root of other programming languages such as C#, Java, and JavaScript. C++ is an enhanced version of C. Many developers today skip learning C on its own, while others think learning C first provides a valuable foundation for C++ development. Both languages are widely used in computer science and programming.</p>
                <h1>2.JAVA</h1>
                <marquee behavior="alternate" direction="right">

                <p> JAVA is one of the most common, in-demand computer programming languages in use today. Owned by the Oracle Corporation, this general-purpose programming language with its object-oriented structure has become a standard for applications that can be used regardless of platform (e.g., Mac, Window, Android, iOS, etc.) because of its Write Once, Run Anywhere (WORA) capabilities</p>
                <p>Java is widely used in web and application development as well as Big Data. Java is also used in the backend of several popular websites, including Google, Amazon, Twitter, and YouTube. It is also extensively used in hundreds of applications. New Java frameworks like Spring, Struts, and Hibernate are also very popular</p>

                <h1>3.PYTHON</h1>

                <p>PYTHON is one of the most commonly used programming languages today and is an easy language for beginners to learn because of its readability. It is a free, open-source programming language with extensive support modules and community development, easy integration with web services, user-friendly data structures, and GUI-based desktop applications. It is a popular programming language for Machine Learning and deep learning applications. Python is used to develop 2D imaging and 3D animation packages like Blender, Inkscape, and Autodesk.</p>
